## Rules

### Rules for all trainers
- Your team must not exceed the level of the original trainer's highest leveled Pokemon by more than 50%. (e.g. Roxanne's Lv. 12 and 14 would allow you to have Lv. 21 Pokemon)	
- You can rename the trainer.	
- You must attempt to maintain some sort of team consistency for repeated trainers. A claim on a repeated trainer is a claim on all of their encounters.
- Trainers that use a Mega Evolution must still use one.
- No Legendaries or Mythicals.

### Rules for boss trainers (gym leaders, Elite 4, Archie, etc.)
- You may add up to 3 additional Pokemon to your trainer.	
- You may give the leader up to two additional HEALING OR BATTLE ITEMS.	
- You may set the AI level to 255.
- Brendan/May are considered a boss, except for Brendan/May 1. You must keep starter consistency, but you can go Hop I Don't Know What I'm Doing Disaster Mode if you like.	
- Tate and Liza are separate claims. I believe you can give them each up to 6? It works in Emerald I know.		
- Gym leaders and Elite 4 members need a theme!	
- Aqua members must primarily use Dark and Water types.	
- Repeated trainers may have one Legendary or Mythical on their final Any% encounter.  (Elite 4 may have one in round 2)
- You may add one Mega if the trainer does not use one and it is after the 4th badge.	
- No limit on held items.	

### Rules for miscelaneous trainers
- You may set the AI level to 135.
- If the trainer is a gym trainer or Team Aqua member, you may give then one item.
- You may change the trainer class of the trainer unless they are a Aqua Grunt.
- If you claimed a gym leader, you have first call on that gym's trainers if you want them.
- No Mega Evolutions.
- You may use one held item.
